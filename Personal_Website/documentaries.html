                    <p class="info">One of the best documentaries available on the use of ayahuasca in contemporary context, in traditional cultures that are being destabilized by the forces of globalization. As Jefferys' documentary makes clear, the revival of traditional shamanic practices with ayahuasca is proving to be a potent political and propaganda tool for reaffirming and preserving cultural values and identity in indigenous societies that are buffeted by environmental, economic, and societal forces beyond their control. - Dennis McKenna PhD, co-author The Invisible Landscape In a time when indigenous people, their culture and the natural environment are experiencing dramatic changes, this in depth series of programs examine what these "Shamans of the Amazon", their hallucinogenic rituals and their special relationship with nature have to offer humanity at this crucial time in history. Discover how westerners around the world are using Ayahuasca and other Shamanic plants to receive knowledge, to understand their relationship with nature and to seek visions of how best to deal with deep personal, spiritual and environmental questions. In a say no to drugs era, there is a new subculture emerging, with a basis of the ancient ritual of hallucinogenic plant use.</p>
