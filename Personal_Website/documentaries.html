                    <p class="info">A satirical yet serious expression that challenges various cultural phenomena existing today which most of society seem to take for granted.

Common themes include Politics, Economics, Education, Security, Religion, Vanity, Governance, Media, Labor, Technology and other issues centric to our daily lives.</p>

                    <p class="info">Dirty Wars follows investigative reporter Jeremy Scahill, author of the international bestseller Blackwater, into the hidden world of America's covert wars, from Afghanistan to Yemen, Somalia, and beyond. Part action film and part detective story, Dirty Wars is a gripping journey into one of the most important and underreported stories of our time. What begins as a report on a deadly U.S. night raid in a remote corner of Afghanistan quickly turns into a global investigation of the secretive and powerful Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). As Scahill digs deeper into the activities of JSOC, he is pulled into a world of covert operations unknown to the public and carried out across the globe by men who do not exist on paper and will never appear before Congress. In military jargon, JSOC teams "find, fix, and finish" their targets, who are selected through a secret process. No target is off limits for the "kill list," including U.S. citizens.</p>

Filmmaker Stephanie Soechtig and TV journalist Katie Couric lead us through this potent exposé that uncovers why-despite media attention, the public's fascination with appearance, and government policies to combat childhood obesity-generations of American children will now live shorter lives than their parents did.</p>

Whether it is Italy with its generous vacation time allotments, France with its gourmet school lunches, Germany with its industrial policy, Norway and its prison system, Tunisia and its strongly progressive women's policy, or Iceland and its strong female presence in government and business among others, Michael Moore discovers there is much that American should emulate.</p>

                    <p class="info">A look at the growing disparity between different economic classes--How did the rich get so...rich? In this hilarious, passionate, and empowering look at income inequality, activist comedian Russell Brand and director Michael Winterbottom (The Trip) uncover the roots of the world financial crisis. With a mix of rabble-rousing outrage and audacious comedy, Brand examines how bank bailouts have left the 99% high and dry-taking his message straight to the top as he fearlessly confronts the corporations and political leaders responsible. By turns thought-provoking and wildly entertaining, The Emperor's New Clothes is a timely reminder that change begins with the people.</p>

                    “I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.” – Woodrow Wilson, after signing the Federal Reserve into existence</p>

                    <p class="info">The Money Masters is a 1996 three and a half hour non-fiction, historical documentary film that discusses the concepts of money, debt, taxes, and describes their development from biblical times onward. It also covers the history of fractional-reserve banking, central banking, monetary policy, the bond market, and the Federal Reserve System in the United States. It explains how throughout the history of the United States, important politicans have been bribed, conned, and even assassinated (including Abraham Lincoln), due to banking related policies. This documentary argues that the profit from issuing money is currently being used in the United States to benefit a few wealthy individuals. It goes further and argues that this situation should be remedied, so that the profit benefits the public good, as during four periods in the history of the United States. Finally it presents a bill, the Monetary Reform Act, to implement such a remedy. As support, the film provides many quotations from notable figures including economists, members of the financial system, kings of England and United States presidents.</p>

                    <h5>Description:</h5>
                    <p class="info">Zeitgeist: Addendum attempts to locate the root causes of the pervasive social corruption, while also offering a solution. This solution is not based on politics, morality, laws, or any other "establishment" notions of human affairs, but rather on a modern, non-superstitious based understanding of what we are and how we align with nature, to which we are a part of. The work advocates a new social system which is updated to present day knowledge, highly influenced by the life long work of Jacque Fresco and The Venus Project.</p>

                    <p class="info">A feature length documentary work which presents a case for a needed transition out of the current socioeconomic monetary paradigm which governs the entire world society. This subject matter will transcend the issues of cultural relativism and traditional ideology and move to relate the core, empirical "life ground" attributes of human and social survival, extrapolating those immutable natural laws into a new sustainable social paradigm called a "Resource-Based Economy".</p>

                    <p class="info">A documentary thriller about the world of cyberwar. For the first time, the film tells the complete story of Stuxnet, a piece of self-replicating computer malware (known as a "worm" for its ability to burrow from computer to computer on its own) that the U.S. and Israel unleashed to destroy a key part of an Iranian nuclear facility, and which ultimately spread beyond its intended target. This is the most comprehensive accounting to date of how a clandestine mission hatched by two allies with clashing agendas opened forever the Pandora's Box of cyberwarfare.</p>

                    <p class="info">One of the best documentaries available on the use of ayahuasca in contemporary context, in traditional cultures that are being destabilized by the forces of globalization. As Jefferys' documentary makes clear, the revival of traditional shamanic practices with ayahuasca is proving to be a potent political and propaganda tool for reaffirming and preserving cultural values and identity in indigenous societies that are buffeted by environmental, economic, and societal forces beyond their control. - Dennis McKenna PhD, co-author The Invisible Landscape In a time when indigenous people, their culture and the natural environment are experiencing dramatic changes, this in depth series of programs examine what these "Shamans of the Amazon", their hallucinogenic rituals and their special relationship with nature have to offer humanity at this crucial time in history. Discover how westerners around the world are using Ayahuasca and other Shamanic plants to receive knowledge, to understand their relationship with nature and to seek visions of how best to deal with deep personal, spiritual and environmental questions. In a say no to drugs era, there is a new subculture emerging, with a basis of the ancient ritual of hallucinogenic plant use.</p>
